                <h2>Internet Homesteading</h2>
                <p>
                    I envision the internet more like the wilderness. Here, you are responsible for your own fortune and
                    well-being. You have freedom, but it comes with responsibility. This concept is what I call internet
                    homesteading â€“ where you build what you can, share with others, and trade with others.

                    You don't rely on any larger entity that restricts or monitors what you do. Yes, it requires hard
                    work and learning new skills, but in order to be truly free, you must leave the comforts behind and
                    adapt to what you can carry with you.

                    Trust me, the rewards of your labor will be worth it. The content you'll have will be valuable and
                    meaningful, your connections won't be superficial, and you'll have control over your own piece of
                    digital property.
