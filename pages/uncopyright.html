                            The internet is built on the foundations of openness and the free flow of information.
                            Embracing uncopyrighted content reinforces these principles, nurturing a digital realm that
                            empowers individuals and communities to freely share knowledge, express themselves, and
                            engage in meaningful conversations. This commitment to an open online environment enhances
                            our collective digital experience.
