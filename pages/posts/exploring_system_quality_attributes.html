                        I practice bushcraft as a hobby in my pastime. It helps me reconnect with nature and exposes me
                        to a way of thinking lost to modernity. Bushcraft involves utilizing resources that your
                        environment provides and turning them into functional and beautiful objects. A couple of years
                        ago, I read the book "Advanced Bushcraft" by David Canterbury.

                        In the book, Mr. Canterbury describes a method for acquiring and selecting equipment for your
                        bushcraft kit. He uses specific system quality attributes that he believes are essential for
                        creating the best kit. These attributes are: Functionality, Affordability, Repeatability,
                        Maintainability, Ergonomics, and Durability, collectively referred to as
                        <strong>FARMED</strong>:

                        What intrigues me is this specific way of thinking, particularly regarding how you select and
                        buy certain products. It also makes me ponder which system quality attributes I would consider
                        when building things for the web. I discovered a list of common attributes on <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes">Wikipedia</a>.
